## ACT vs SAT: The Battle of Standardized Tests

### Problem Statement 

Where should the College Board spend it's marketing dollars to increase SAT participation rates?

### Executive Summary

The SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) is a standardized test used for college admissions in the United States designed to test high school students' general educational development and readiness for college studies. It is owned and administered by the College Board. The ACTs (American College Testing) is a different standardized test used for college admissions, and is a competitor to the SAT. The two tests are similar in content but differ in format. The SAT is made up of two sections scored out of 800, while the ACT is made up of four sections scored out of 36.

Both exams are nationally recognized in the U.S. and are common admission requirements to universities. In some states, it is mandatory for all high school students to take the ACTs or the SATs. Since universities accept scores from either the SAT or the ACT, students can decide which one they want to take or take both exams.

Data was collected on participation rates and mean scores of the SATs and ACTs for the years 2017 and 2018 following certain structural and content changes commissioned to the SAT by College Board in 2016. This study analyses the data at hand to make recommendations to College Board about which states money would be best spent in to improve SAT participation rates. A number of interesting discoveries are made regarding SAT/ACT participation rates across the U.S., the relationship of participation rates with mean scores, and the reasons behind why some states decide to make one exam over the other mandatory.

Final recommendations to the College Board are as follows:
- Keep improving the SAT
- Focus marketing efforts in the East and West coast
- Try to win states where ACT is mandatory by going directly to the policy makers

### Conclusions and Recommendations

#### Key Takeaways

- Where students live in the U.S. is an important factor in which test they end up taking. It turns out that SAT is more popular with states in the East and West coast, while the ACT is more popular in the mid-West. A lot of states in these regions require high school students to take either one of the exams as part of their state wide high school curriculum. Since colleges across the U.S. accept scores from both exams, students whose state mandate a specific exam usually don't take the other one. That said, some very eager students do take both exams, likely to use the one that they score better in with their university applications.

- It is tempting to try to compare such things as the quality of different states' high school education, or the difficulty level of the two exams based on the mean scores students achieve from these standardized tests. Such deductions are misleading as there is an inherent bias in the data. When participation rates are high in a state because the government instated an exam or it is norm to take a specific exam, all kinds of students are taking the test, from the most ambitious to the most slacker. On the contrary, when participation rates are low, it is only the most perfectionist students that take the exam, who tend to score higher than the average. To make accurate conclusions, the states whose scores are being compared need to have similar participation rates in the exam.

- A variety of factors play into the decision of states to make the SAT or the ACT mandatory. These can range from economic ones to educational/content-related, to practical. Cases of Illinois, Colorado and Connecticut provided an example for each of these factors. In Illinois, the state had an economic interest in selecting the exam provider that bid a higher amount to procure the contract. In Colorado, it was tought that the SAT aligned better with that states high school curriculum, and the resources College Board provided to students to study and improve their scores were deemed to be better than that of the ACT. Finally, in Connecticut, SAT was already the exam of choice by most students and so, it simply made more sense to pick SAT.

#### Final Recommendations
- Keep improving the SAT. As shown by the example of Colorado, having an exam better aligned with the state high school curriculums and providing students with better resources for preperation can actually persuade states to opt for the SAT over the ACT. Seeing that participation rates in the SAT improved greatly from 2017 to 2018, it appears that the 2016 changes were well received and that the College Board is on the right track.

- Focus marketing dollars in the West and East coast as students in these states have the highest likelihood of choosing the SAT over the ACT. Since the decision to take which exam is largely a factor of where students live, trying to grab the extra market share in areas where SAT is more popular will have a higher possibility of yielding favorable outcomes at a lower cost than trying to establish SAT as an alternative in markets where the ACT dominates.

- Try to win states where ACT is mandatory by going directly to the policy makers. Spending marketing dollars in states where the ACT is mandatory will be a waste of money. Since universities accept both tests, most students only take either the SAT or the ACT, as shown by the high negative correlation between participation_act and participation_sat in our dataset. Instead, the College Board should take a top down approach and place its efforts directly with the policy makers.

#### Future Considerations

In recent years, some colleges have begun to drop requirements for prospective students to submit ACT/SAT scores. Princeton, Stanford and NYU are amongst the universities that have elimited this mandate.
With prep programs charging students thousands of dollars, the primary concern of these universities is that achieving a high score on these exams has become more a function of family income than hard work or intelligence.
With this in mind, College Board should continue to work to make the SAT a more fair and accessible test by expanding its free preparatory resources and developing technologies like the SAT app that provide students from all income groups the ability to prep and improve their scores.
